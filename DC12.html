            <p><span>Woman:</span> So, whatâ€™s your usual day like? You always seem so busy.</p>
            <p><span>Man:</span> Well, I usually get up around 5:00 a.m. and work on the computer until 6:00 a.m.</p>
            <p><span>Woman:</span> Why do you get up so early?</p>
            <p><span>Man:</span> Well, I have to leave home at twenty to seven (6:40 a.m.) so I can catch a bus at 7:00 oâ€™clock. It takes me about twenty minutes to walk to the bus stop from my house.</p>
            <p><span>Woman:</span> And what time do you get to work?</p>
            <p><span>Man:</span> Uh, my bus takes about an hour to get there, but it stops right in front of my office.</p>
            <p><span>Woman:</span> Thatâ€™s nice. And what time do you get off work?</p>
            <p><span>Man:</span> Uh, around 5:00 oâ€™clock. Then, we eat dinner around 6:30, and my wife and I read and play with the kids until 8:00 or so.</p>
            <p><span>Woman:</span> So, when do you work on your website? You said one time that you create it at home?</p>
            <p><span>Man:</span> Well, my wife and I often watch TV or talk until 10:00 oâ€™clock. She then often reads while I work on my site, and I sometimes stay up until the early hours of the morning, but I try to finish everything by one or two.</p>
            <p><span>Woman:</span> And then you get up at 5:00 a.m.?</p>
            <p><span>Man:</span> Well, yeah, but itâ€™s important to live a balanced life. I enjoy what I do, but you have to set aside time for the family and yourself.</p>
            <p><span>Woman:</span> I agree.</p>
            <p><span>Man:</span> But I think my wife has the toughest job. She spends her whole day taking care of our family . . . taking the kids to school, working in the garden, buying groceries, taking the kids to piano lessons . . . [Wow!] Itâ€™s a full-time job, but she enjoys what she does.</p>
            <p><span>Woman:</span> Well, it sounds like youâ€™re a busy, but lucky man.</p>
            <p><span>Man:</span> I think so too.</p>
